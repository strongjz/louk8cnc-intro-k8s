### Container security primitives
* SElinux 
* AppArmor
* Seccomp https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/#run-without-the-default-seccomp-profile

### Container Pipeline
* Establish a pipeline to build a standard image
* Have a versioning policy
* Allow to only run images based of the standard image
* Use the same OS as the host
* Keep the image small
* Use a private registry
* Donâ€™t embed secrets into images, use Hashicorp Vault

The installer will install all necessary dependencies, including the needed Python version, by default. If you already have Python 2.x.y installed and want to use the existing installation, you can uncheck the option to install Bundled Python. Note: As of Cloud SDK version 206.0.0, the gcloud CLI has experimental support for running using a Python 3.4+ interpreter (run gcloud topic startup for exclusions and more information on configuring your Python interpreter). All other Cloud SDK tools still require a Python 2.7 interpreter. After installation has completed, accept the following options:\nWindows  Download the Cloud SDK installer. The installer is signed by Google Inc.\n Launch the installer and follow the prompts.\n After installation has completed, accept the following options:\nStart Cloud SDK Shell Run gcloud init\n  Mac  Double Check Python 2 is installed.  python -V   Download one of the following:\nmacOS 64-bit\nmacOS 32-bit\nExtract the contents of the file to any location on your file system.\n Install with this script\n  ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh   Initialize the install. Open a new terminal so that the changes take effect. Run gcloud init to initialize the SDK:  ./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init  kubectl You can install kubectl as part of the Google Cloud SDK.\nRun the kubectl installation command:\ngcloud components install kubectl  Test to ensure the version you installed is sufficiently up-to-date:\nkubectl version  Git Download git client from Git Scm\nSlack We will be using to ask/answer questions during and after the workshop.
